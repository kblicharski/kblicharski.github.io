## Work Experience

---

### Research Assistant @ The Computational Logic Center
#### *August 2019 - Present*

---

### Fullstack Software Engineering Intern @ The Signal Center
#### *May 2017 - August 2019*

I've worked at The Signal Center for the better part of two years now -- full time during the summer and school breaks, and part time otherwise. The projects I work on are fundamentally research-oriented and are associated with the Computational Epidemiology Group at the University of Iowa. The application I have been working on for the most part is called Maptrek. It's a web application which integrates the Fitbit and Google Maps APIs in order to allow participants to view their progress on a real-world route and compete with people of similar activity levels.

When I started during the summer of 2017, I worked on an API wrapper for Hologram.io where I learned the basics of Django. I continued learning about Django as I contributed to the backend of Maptrek for the remainder of the summer, but towards the end my supervisor allowed me to branch out into frontend as well. I took the initiative to begin migrating the application frontend to Angular, but it was eventually decided that React was a better fit.

Since then I've been working as time permits, with my academic success being prioritized. For this reason, my time worked has varied dramatically, from working 40 hours a week to not at all for a month. Thankfully, the position affords a great deal of flexibility, and I've been working remotely and independently for the majority of it. The position has forced me to learn a little about everything -- frontend, backend, devops, and everything inbetween.

### Backend Software Developer @ Graze Analytics
#### *December 2018 - August 2019*

This position has me mainly doing Ruby on Rails and React development work, with devops and deployment where needed. This was initially my senior design project, but our team has decided to commit more time to it in order to found our own startup. Currently it is me and three other developers, but we're excited with our product and think it has business potential. This position takes up around 10 hours of my time per week, but it will probably increase as we get closer to launch.

### Computers in Engineering TA @ The University of Iowa
#### *August 2018 - January 2019* 
I decided to TA to gain experience teaching. Helping others learn is something I've always been interested in and enjoyed, but most of my prior exposure was in the form of tutoring. TAing is not too dissimilar, but carries with it its own challenges. 

I helped teach C++, OOP, and Unix fundamentals to a class of over 140 students. We covered topics including dynamic memory management, iterators, standard library container types, linked lists, pointers, and much more. At times I assisted the instructors by helping to create quizzes -- it's honestly surprising how much effort is involved in creating good quiz questions!

While I enjoyed teaching, I found the management side of the position to be perhaps more interesting. The course maintains a large SVN repository to handle student submissions, and I figured I could make my job easier by automating what I could. 

I wrote scripts to automatically determine homeworks that were not attempted, to determine non-compiling homeworks, and to chunk students into grading sections. The amount of time these saved was immeasurable. This was the first time I seriously decided to play around with Bash (the scripts being a few hundred lines long), and I'm glad that I did -- I've come to appreciate its power, but I'll probably still stick with Python for most tasks.

### Computer Science Private Tutor @ The University of Iowa
#### *January 2017 - Present*

The University of Iowa maintains a list of approved tutors for computer science courses, and I applied to be on it and was approved for most undergraduate courses.

Students approach me asking to be tutored fairly infrequently, but over the years I've tutored over two dozen different students. The additional work is always appreciated, and I've found in many cases it forces me to remain on top of programming languages and skills I haven't used in a while.
