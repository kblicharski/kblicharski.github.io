## About Me
<img class="profile-picture" src="{{ site.avatar_url }}">

Hello, and welcome to my personal website!

I'm a senior at the University of Iowa studying Computer Science & Engineering.

After I graduate this May, I intend on pursuing a master's degree. That is why I am seeking an internship rather than a full-time position for this summer.

I have had extensive professional experience with a broad set of technologies, programming languages, and fields. This has been primarily in start-up or research environments, where the ability to learn quickly is mandatory. This has made me into a jack-of-all-trades -- I have had exposure to frontend, backend, devops, and everything inbetween. I hope that this shines through in my code and my projects. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to send me an email!
