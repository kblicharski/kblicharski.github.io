This is my personal website! At the moment it's derived from the [Jekyll Researcher theme](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/researcher/), but I anticipate I'll customize the CSS when I get some free time.

I eventually plan on using this to start a blog, but that's a large undertaking that I'm not quite ready to commit to. Stay tuned.
